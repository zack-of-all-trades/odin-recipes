        </div>

        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>4 large green bell peppers, cut in half lengthwise, seeds removed</li>
            <li>1 pound italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked brown or jasmine rice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar Tomato and Basil Pasta Sauce, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>

        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a roasting pan (large enough to accommodate 8 pepper halves 
                    in a single layer) with cooking spray.</li>
                <p><li>Combine the ground sirloin, Italian sausage, brown rice, Italian seasonings, salt, pepper, garlic, Parmesan 
                    cheese, egg, and 1/2 cup Tomato & Basil sauce in a large bowl. Mix until combined.</li></p>
                <li>Divide meat mixture evenly among the green pepper halves; press to compress slightly. Arrange halves in prepared 
                    pan. Spoon the remaining Tomato & Basil sauce onto the tops of the meat and peppers. Cover tightly with 
                    foil.</li>
                <p><li>Bake until the peppers are soft and internal temperature of the meat reaches 165 degrees F, about 1 1/2 
                    hours.</li></p>
                <li>Remove from oven. Remove foil and top each pepper with shredded cheese.</li>
                <p><li>Turn oven to broil. Place peppers, uncovered under the broiler. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, 
                    about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.</li></p>
            </ol>
