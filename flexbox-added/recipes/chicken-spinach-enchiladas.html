        </ul>

        <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>

        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <p><li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir green onions and garlic in butter until fragrant and 
                    softened, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken, spinach, chili powder, black pepper, and salt into the green onion mixture 
                    and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Mix ricotta cheese, sour cream, 1 cup Monterey 
                    Jack cheese, and 1 cup of mozzarella cheese into chicken mixture until thoroughly combined. Reserve remaining 
                    Monterey Jack and mozzarella cheeses for topping.</li></p>
                <li>Place tortillas into a plastic bag, seal bag, and microwave on high until warm and soft, 30 to 45 seconds. Spoon 
                    about 3/4 cup of chicken filling down the center of each tortilla in a line. Roll tortillas around filling and 
                    place with seam sides down into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <p><li>Pour enchilada sauce over filled enchiladas and sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack and mozzarella 
                    cheeses over the top.</li></p>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbling and cheese topping is browned at the edges, about 30 
                    minutes.</li>
            </ol>
