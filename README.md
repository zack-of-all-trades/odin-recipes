# odin-recipes

This is my first "big" project from The Odin Project lessons.

I am to demonstrate what I have learned so far by creating a main index HTML webpage with links to individual recipes.
By the end of the project I hope do have demonstrated the following skills:  create an index file and html boilerplate, 
properly use elements and tags to make things look organized and neat, create images, create links, and use GitHub throughout
making the webpage to maintain  usable "save" points.
